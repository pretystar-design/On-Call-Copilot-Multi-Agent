# Building an On-Call Copilot with Microsoft Agent Framework: Four AI Agents, One Incident Response

*April 2026 · Lee Stott, Microsoft*

---

When an incident fires at 3 am, every second the on-call engineer spends piecing together alerts, logs, and metrics is a second not spent fixing the problem. This post walks through how we built **On-Call Copilot**: a multi-agent AI system that ingests raw incident signals and returns structured triage, a Slack update, a stakeholder brief, and a draft post-incident report in under 10 seconds.

The full sample code is at [github.com/microsoft-foundry/oncall-copilot](https://github.com/microsoft-foundry/oncall-copilot). Deploy it to your own Foundry project with `azd deploy` and have it responding to incidents in under five minutes.

## The Problem with Single-Agent Triage

Early AI incident assistants used a single large prompt: *"Here is the incident. Give me root causes, actions, a Slack message, and a post-incident report."* This approach suffers from two problems:

1. **Context overload.** A real incident may have 800 lines of logs, 10 alert lines, and dense metrics. Asking one model to process everything and produce four distinct output formats in a single turn pushes token limits and degrades output quality.
2. **Conflicting concerns.** Triage reasoning and communication drafting are cognitively different tasks. A model optimised for structured JSON analysis often produces stilted Slack messages, and vice versa.

The fix is specialisation: decompose the task into focused agents and run them in parallel.

---

## Architecture

On-Call Copilot is deployed as a **Foundry Hosted Agent**, a containerised Python service that runs on Microsoft Foundry's managed infrastructure. The core orchestrator uses `ConcurrentBuilder` from the Microsoft Agent Framework SDK to run four specialist agents in parallel via `asyncio.gather()`.

   Structured JSON response
```

All four agents share a single Azure OpenAI **Model Router** deployment. This is important: rather than hardcoding `gpt-4o` or `gpt-4o-mini` for each agent, Model Router analyses the request complexity and routes automatically. A simple triage prompt costs less; a long post-incident synthesis uses a more capable model. One deployment name, zero model-selection code.

---

## The Code

### Orchestrator (`main.py`)

The entry point is remarkably concise. `ConcurrentBuilder` handles all the async wiring:

```python
from agent_framework import Agent
from agent_framework_foundry import FoundryChatClient
from agent_framework_foundry_hosting import ResponsesHostServer
from agent_framework_orchestrations import ConcurrentBuilder
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential

_credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
chat_client = FoundryChatClient(project_endpoint=project_endpoint, model=model, credential=_credential)

def create_workflow():
  triage = Agent(
    client=chat_client,
        instructions=TRIAGE_INSTRUCTIONS,
        name="triage-agent",
    )
  summary = Agent(
    client=chat_client,
        instructions=SUMMARY_INSTRUCTIONS,
        name="summary-agent",
    )
  comms = Agent(
    client=chat_client,
        instructions=COMMS_INSTRUCTIONS,
        name="comms-agent",
    )
  pir = Agent(
    client=chat_client,
        instructions=PIR_INSTRUCTIONS,
        name="pir-agent",
    )
  return ConcurrentBuilder(participants=[triage, summary, comms, pir]).build()

def main():
    ResponsesHostServer(create_workflow().as_agent(name="oncall-copilot")).run(port=8088)
```

`DefaultAzureCredential` means the container uses managed identity in production and your local `az login` session in development; no secrets, no key rotation.

### Agent Instructions

Each agent receives a tightly scoped system prompt. Here is the Triage Agent, which is responsible for root cause analysis only:

```python
TRIAGE_INSTRUCTIONS = """
You are the Triage Agent, an expert SRE specialising in root cause analysis.

## Task
Analyse the incident data and return a single JSON object with ONLY these keys:

{
  "suspected_root_causes": [
    {
      "hypothesis": "concise root cause hypothesis",
      "evidence": ["supporting evidence from the input"],
      "confidence": 0.87
    }
  ],
  "immediate_actions": [
    {
      "step": "concrete action with runnable command if applicable",
      "owner_role": "oncall-eng | dba | infra-eng | platform-eng",
      "priority": "P0 | P1 | P2 | P3"
    }
  ],
  "missing_information": [
    {
      "question": "what data is missing",
      "why_it_matters": "why this data would help"
    }
  ],
  "runbook_alignment": {
    "matched_steps": ["runbook steps that match the situation"],
    "gaps": ["gaps or missing runbook coverage"]
  }
}

## Guardrails
- No hallucination: if data is insufficient, set confidence to 0 and populate missing_information
- No secrets: redact credential-like material as [REDACTED]
- Structured output only: return ONLY valid JSON, no prose
"""
```

The other three agents follow the same pattern, each owning their section of the output schema:

| Agent | Output keys | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **Triage** | `suspected_root_causes`, `immediate_actions`, `missing_information`, `runbook_alignment` | Root cause analysis, immediate response steps |
| **Summary** | `summary.what_happened`, `summary.current_status` | Plain-language incident narrative |
| **Comms** | `comms.slack_update`, `comms.stakeholder_update` | Slack message and executive brief |
| **PIR** | `post_incident_report.timeline`, `.customer_impact`, `.prevention_actions` | Draft post-incident report |

### Input Schema

The agent accepts a single JSON envelope; it can come from a monitoring alert webhook, a PagerDuty payload, or a manual CLI invocation:

```json
{
  "incident_id": "INC-20260217-002",
  "title": "DB connection pool exhausted — checkout-api degraded",
  "severity": "SEV1",
  "timeframe": { "start": "2026-02-17T14:02:00Z", "end": null },
  "alerts": [
    {
      "name": "DatabaseConnectionPoolNearLimit",
      "description": "Connection pool at 99.7% on orders-db-primary",
      "timestamp": "2026-02-17T14:03:00Z"
    }
  ],
  "logs": [
    {
      "source": "order-worker",
      "lines": [
        "ERROR: connection timeout after 30s (attempt 3/3)",
        "WARN: pool exhausted, queueing request (queue_depth=847)"
      ]
    }
  ],
  "metrics": [
    {
      "name": "db_connection_pool_utilization_pct",
      "window": "5m",
      "values_summary": "Jumped from 22% to 99.7% at 14:03Z"
    }
  ],
  "runbook_excerpt": "Step 1: Check DB connection dashboard...",
  "constraints": {
    "max_time_minutes": 15,
    "environment": "production",
    "region": "swedencentral"
  }
}
```

### Invoking the Deployed Agent

```bash
# Using the included invoke script
export AZURE_AI_PROJECT_ENDPOINT="https://<account>.services.ai.azure.com/api/projects/<project>"

python scripts/invoke.py --demo 2      # multi-signal SEV1 demo
python scripts/invoke.py --scenario 1  # Redis cluster outage scenario

# Or with curl directly
TOKEN=$(az account get-access-token --resource https://ai.azure.com --query accessToken -o tsv)

curl -X POST "$AZURE_AI_PROJECT_ENDPOINT/agents/oncall-copilot/endpoint/protocols/openai/responses?api-version=2025-11-15-preview" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-ms-protocol-version: 1.0.0" \
  -d '{
    "input": [{"role": "user", "content": "<incident JSON here>"}]
  }'
```

---

## The Local UI

To make the agent accessible to people who aren't comfortable with curl, the project includes a zero-dependency browser UI (`ui/`) built with plain HTML + CSS + vanilla JavaScript. No React, no bundler; just a Python `http.server` backend that proxies requests to the Foundry endpoint.

![On-Call Copilot UI: empty state with quick-load preset buttons](./screenshots/ui_01_empty_state.png)

*The empty state. Quick-load buttons at the top left pre-populate the JSON editor with any of the 3 demo incidents or 5 scenario files.*

### Loading an Incident

Click a quick-load button and the JSON editor fills instantly with the full incident payload, a severity badge appears, and the editor validates the JSON in real time.

![Quick-load dropdown with demo and scenario presets](./screenshots/ui_02_quick_load.png)

*The quick-load panel: 3 demo incidents and 5 scenario files ready to load.*

![Demo 1 loaded: API Gateway SEV3 incident JSON in editor](./screenshots/ui_03_incident_loaded.png)

*Demo 1 loaded: API Gateway 5xx spike, SEV3. The JSON is editable, so you can modify any field before submitting.*

### Running the Analysis

Hit **▶ Run Analysis** (or Ctrl+Enter). The four output panels switch to a skeleton loading state while the live Foundry request is in flight (~8 seconds for a complex incident).

### Results: All Four Agents

When the response arrives, all four panels populate simultaneously:

![Full results: all four agent panels](./screenshots/ui_04_results_overview.png)

*All four panels populated: Triage (red), Summary (blue), Comms (green), PIR (purple).*

#### Triage Panel

Root causes are ranked by confidence. Evidence is collapsed under each hypothesis. The Actions tab shows immediate steps with priority badges (P0/P1/P2) and owner roles.

![Triage panel: root causes with confidence bars](./screenshots/ui_05_triage.png)

![Triage panel: immediate actions tab](./screenshots/ui_09_triage_actions.png)

#### Summary Panel

A plain-language narrative paragraph followed by an ONGOING / RESOLVED status box. If the input incident has metrics, key values are shown below.

![Summary panel: narrative and ONGOING status](./screenshots/ui_06_summary.png)

#### Comms Panel

The Slack card renders the `slack_update` field with Slack emoji substitution and bold text markup. The stakeholder card shows the executive summary with a blue left border.

![Comms panel: Slack card and stakeholder update](./screenshots/ui_07_comms.png)

#### Post-Incident Report Panel

The PIR timeline uses a vertical dot-and-line layout. An ONGOING event pulses in yellow. Customer impact is shown in a red-bordered box, followed by numbered prevention actions.

![PIR panel: timeline and prevention actions](./screenshots/ui_08_pir.png)

### Starting the UI

```powershell
# Windows PowerShell
$env:AZURE_AI_PROJECT_ENDPOINT = "https://<account>.services.ai.azure.com/api/projects/<project>"
$env:AGENT_NAME = "oncall-copilot"
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe ui\server.py
# → open http://localhost:7860
```

```bash
# Bash
export AZURE_AI_PROJECT_ENDPOINT="https://<account>.services.ai.azure.com/api/projects/<project>"
export AGENT_NAME="oncall-copilot"
python ui/server.py
```

The server uses Python's stdlib `http.server` with `ThreadingMixIn` for concurrent request handling, plus `requests` and `python-dotenv` — both are already in `requirements.txt`. Authentication tries `AzureCliCredential` first (reusing your `az login` session) and falls back to `InteractiveBrowserCredential`, so it works out of the box on most developer machines.

---

## Deployment

### Option A: `azd deploy` (under 4 minutes)

With infrastructure pre-provisioned (Foundry project, ACR, Model Router deployment, RBAC), deployment is a single command:

```bash
azd deploy --no-prompt
```

This builds the Docker image via remote ACR build, pushes it, and creates the Hosted Agent version. The `agent.yaml` defines the agent name, protocols, and environment variable bindings; `azure.yaml` configures the container resources (1 vCPU, 2 GiB memory) and model deployments.

If you also need to provision the infrastructure from scratch, use `azd up` which runs both provisioning and deployment.

### Option B: Python SDK deploy script

```bash
export ACR_IMAGE="<your-registry>.azurecr.io/oncall-copilot:v1"
export MODEL_ROUTER_DEPLOYMENT="model-router"

# Build and push (must be linux/amd64)
docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t oncall-copilot:v1 .
docker tag oncall-copilot:v1 $ACR_IMAGE
docker push $ACR_IMAGE

# Create the hosted agent
python scripts/deploy_sdk.py
```

The deploy script handles creating the capability host, registering the container, and waiting for the `Started` status.

---

## Five Key Design Decisions

### 1. Parallel over sequential

Running the four agents concurrently cuts total latency by 3–4×. A SEV1 incident with full context takes ~8 seconds; sequentially it would take ~30 seconds. `asyncio.gather()` is the right primitive here: each agent is independent and can process the full incident payload in isolation.

### 2. JSON-only agent instructions

Every agent is instructed to return *only* valid JSON with a defined schema. This makes the output trivially mergeable; the orchestrator just does `merged.update(agent_output)` for each response. No parsing, no extraction, no post-processing.

### 3. No hardcoded model names

`AZURE_OPENAI_CHAT_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=model-router` is the only model reference in the codebase. Model Router handles the gpt-4o vs gpt-4o-mini vs o3-mini decision at runtime based on prompt complexity. When new models are released to Model Router, the agent gets better for free.

### 4. `DefaultAzureCredential` everywhere

No API keys. No token management code. The hosted container uses a managed identity. Local development uses the `az login` session via `AzureCliCredential`. The UI server tries CLI credentials first and falls back to browser-based sign-in. The same code runs in both environments without modification.

### 5. Separation of instructions from code

Each agent's system prompt is a plain Python string in `app/agents/<name>.py`. This means a non-developer can refine agent behaviour by editing a text file and redeploying, with no Python knowledge needed.

---

## Guardrails Built Into the Prompts

The agent instructions include explicit guardrails that don't require external filtering:

- **No hallucination**: when data is insufficient, the agent sets `confidence: 0` and adds entries to `missing_information` rather than inventing facts.
- **Secret redaction**: each agent is instructed to redact credential-like patterns as `[REDACTED]` in its output.
- **Mark unknowns**: undeterminable fields use the literal string `"UNKNOWN"` rather than plausible-sounding guesses.
- **Diagnostic suggestions**: when signal is sparse, `immediate_actions` includes diagnostic steps that will gather the missing information before prescribing a fix.

---

## Response Rate: What to Expect

| Incident type | Complexity | Typical latency |
|---|---|---|
| Single alert, minimal context (SEV4) | Low | 4–6 s |
| Multi-signal, logs + metrics (SEV2) | Medium | 7–10 s |
| Full SEV1 with long log lines | High | 10–15 s |
| Post-incident synthesis (resolved) | High | 10–14 s |

For comparison: running the four agents sequentially on a SEV1 incident would take approximately 30–40 seconds. Concurrent execution brings this under 15 seconds for all tested scenarios.

## What's Next

A few natural extensions:

- **Webhook integration**: a thin adapter that accepts PagerDuty, OpsGenie, or Datadog webhook payloads and converts them to the incident envelope schema before forwarding to the agent.
- **Ticket auto-creation**: add a fifth agent (post-resolution) that creates a Jira or Azure DevOps ticket from the PIR output.
- **Human-in-the-loop**: surface the `missing_information` list back to the on-call engineer as a form before proceeding, so the agent can re-run with the gaps filled.
- **Feedback loop**: track confidence vs actual root cause accuracy over time; use the delta to improve agent instructions.

## April 2026 Update

Since the initial February release, the project has been fully deployed as a **Foundry Hosted Agent** running on Microsoft Agent Framework 1.2.0. Key updates:

- **Successful end-to-end deployment**: The agent is live on Microsoft Foundry in Sweden Central, responding to all 8 test incident scenarios (3 demos + 5 scenarios) with full structured output in ~19 seconds.
- **SDK stack**: `agent-framework==1.2.0`, `agent-framework-foundry==1.2.0`, `agent-framework-foundry-hosting==1.0.0a260424`, `agent-framework-orchestrations==1.0.0b260424`.
- **UI server improvements**: Added `ThreadingMixIn` for concurrent request handling, `AzureCliCredential` as the primary auth method (falls back to browser sign-in), and fixed a variable reference bug in agent invocation.
- **Deployment simplified**: With infrastructure pre-provisioned, `azd deploy --no-prompt` completes in under 4 minutes including remote ACR image build.
